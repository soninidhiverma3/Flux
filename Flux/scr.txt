It's amazing. Who's the artist?

What? This chit of a girl?

I want to have this little package
on our mantelpiece.

Edward.
-Yes, sir.

The Lady is giving you a token of
appreciation for your childs song.

Take it, Loki.

At your service, Lady.

At your service, Lord.

Malli.

Loki, the money they have given you
was not for the song.

Theyve bought your daughter.

MALLI!

Malli.

Malli... Malli...

My child.

Please give me back my child.

I fall at your feet.

I beg you!

I beg you.
I fall at your feet.

Sergeant!

Do you comprehend the value
of the b*llet in your barrel?

It was manufactured in an English factory
using English metals.

It crossed the 7 seas in an English vessel.

By the time it reached
the barrel of your g*n

it cost One Pound.

One Pound Sterling!

And you would want to squander it on

brown rubbish?

Clear the road.

Please dont take my child away
Im begging you

Lady, please.

THE FIRE

OUTSKIRTS OF DELHI

Release our leader Lala Lajpat Rai!
Otherwise well burn down this police station!

Release our leader Lala Lajpat Rai!

Of course not, sir.
We havent done anything to provoke them.

They are rioting here because
Lala Lajpat Rai has been arrested in Calcutta.

Theyre rabid!

We need reinforcements NOW!

It's going to take another 7 hours.

Hold the line, damn it!

Lets burn them down!

Arrest that bastard

and

bring him to me

You double-crosser!

You filthy traitor!

Good God!

That mob!

I was scared out of my wits, sir!

He scares me more.
